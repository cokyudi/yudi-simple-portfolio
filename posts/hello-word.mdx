If you’re reading this, you’re looking at the very first post on my **personal blog**—and honestly, that feels both exciting and a little scary.

I’ve been thinking about starting a blog for a long time. This year, I finally decided to stop overthinking and just start.

This blog is my place to grow as a **web developer and full-stack engineer**, especially by diving deeper into **Next.js, SEO, and Core Web Vitals**. It’s also where I’ll share what I learn, what I break, what I fix, and what I experience along the way.  
And who knows—maybe one day this blog will even make money 😆

But before we get into the technical stuff, let me tell you a bit about the person behind the keyboard.

## Who is Yudi, really?

Let’s start simple.  
My name is Yudi, and I’m from Bali, Indonesia.

Now, here’s the part where things get interesting 😅  
My full name is *Cokorda Gede Agung Yudi Dharma Putra*.

Yes, it’s long.  
No, I don’t expect you to remember it.

In Indonesia, names don’t always follow the “first name–last name” system that many countries use. Some people even have just one name. If that sounds confusing, you’re not alone—there’s a good explanation here: [Indonesian names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_names#:~:text=Legally%2C%20Indonesian%20personal%20names%20are,Suharto%20is%20another%20example.).

## Two things that almost always come up

If you ask people who know me well to describe me, two words usually appear pretty quickly:  
**football** and **anime**.

Football is something I enjoy both playing and watching. My favorite club is *Manchester United*—a decision that comes with years of emotional ups and downs 😅. I mostly follow European football, not just the matches but also transfer news and club updates. Watching football content on social media has surprisingly helped me improve my English as well.

Anime is the other half of that story. I’m not the type who watches everything, but I’m a big fan of *Shonen Jump* series like *Naruto*, *One Piece*, *Bleach*, and *Jujutsu Kaisen*. Solid stories, strong characters, and long journeys—maybe that’s why I like them.

## An all-rounder mindset

If I had to describe myself in one sentence, it would be this:  
I’m an all-rounder, not a master—and I’m still learning.

I can play football, badminton, and swim. I *think* I could also play basketball, volleyball, or even baseball… though that’s still unproven 😅.  
Outside of sports, I’ve tried music, latte art, drawing, driving, coding, and designing.

I wouldn’t say I’m an expert in all of them, but I’m comfortable trying new things. That mindset fits perfectly with my current role as a **Full-stack Engineer**, where learning never really stops and versatility matters.

## From Bali to Japan

Since 2022, I’ve been living in Japan.

I originally came here as a Japanese language school student with a scholarship. After that chapter, I transitioned into working as a **Full-stack Engineer at a company in Japan**. It hasn’t always been easy, but it’s been incredibly rewarding—both professionally and personally.

Living and working in Japan has shaped how I think, how I work, and how I approach learning.

## Why this blog exists

This blog is more than just a place to post code snippets or tutorials.  
It’s a record of my journey—through **web development**, life in **Japan**, continuous learning, and everything in between.

I hope I can stay consistent, keep writing, and share things that are useful—or at least relatable—to someone out there reading this.

I’ll end this first post with a quote that really sticks with me:

**“Real power is not hitting hard, but hitting the target.”**
