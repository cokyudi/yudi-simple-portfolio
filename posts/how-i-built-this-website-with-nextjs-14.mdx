## Introduction

Before I could write my first blog post, I had to **build the website itself**.

This website is more than just a blog. The main page highlights my **work experience**, visitors can **download my CV**, and the blog is a space where I share what I learn along the way.

I wanted something fast, SEO-friendly, and easy to evolve over time. That’s why I chose **Next.js 14** as the foundation.

In this post, I’ll share **how I built this site**, why I chose each part of the stack, and what I learned throughout the process.

## Why I Built My Own Website

There are many portfolio templates and blogging platforms available, but I wanted something that truly felt like *mine*.

My goals were simple:
- Showcase my **professional experience** clearly
- Provide a **downloadable CV**
- Have a **blog** for learning notes and experiments
- Leave room to grow and improve over time

I also wanted a real project where I could practice modern web development techniques instead of just reading about them.

## Why Next.js 14

Next.js 14 felt like the right choice for this project.

Some of the reasons:
- **App Router** for clean and scalable routing
- **Built-in SEO support** with the Metadata API
- Excellent performance out of the box
- Easy handling of **static and dynamic content**
- Smooth deployment experience with **Vercel**

It allows me to focus more on content and structure, rather than spending too much time on setup.

## My Tech Stack

Here’s what powers the site and why I chose each part:

- **Next.js 14** — Core framework using the App Router
- **TypeScript** — Type safety and better maintainability
- **Tailwind CSS** — Fast and consistent styling
- **Markdown / MDX** — Simple and readable blog content
- **Framer Motion** — Subtle animations and motion UI
- **Vercel** — Deployment and hosting
- **Vercel Analytics** — Performance and traffic insights
- **Google Analytics** — Visitor behavior and page tracking

---

## Motion UI (My Tech Stack Section)

I wanted the site to feel smooth and modern without being distracting.

Using **Framer Motion**, I added:
- Gentle fade-in animations
- Small transitions when sections appear
- Lightweight interactions that guide attention

These animations are intentionally subtle — the goal is to enhance the experience, not compete with the content.

---

## Analytics & Monitoring

Once the site was live, I wanted to understand how people actually use it.

That’s why I added:
- **Vercel Analytics** to monitor performance, page views, and Core Web Vitals
- **Google Analytics** to understand visitor behavior, popular pages, and traffic sources

This setup helps me:
- See which pages are visited most
- Measure whether the blog is being discovered
- Track improvements as I iterate on SEO and performance

Instead of guessing, I can now make decisions based on real data.

## Project Structure (Based on My GitHub)

You can see the full source code here:  
https://github.com/cokyudi/yudi-simple-portfolio

A simplified overview of the folder structure:

```txt
components/        # Reusable UI components
constants/         # Navigation links and constants
lib/               # Utility functions (markdown, helpers)
pages/             # Routes for portfolio and blog
posts/             # Markdown blog content
public/            # Static assets (images, CV PDF)
styles/            # Global styles and Tailwind config
```
This structure keeps content, UI, and logic clearly separated and easy to maintain.

---
## What Went Well

A few things worked especially well during development:
- SEO setup using Next.js Metadata was straightforward
- Static pages load quickly
- Deployment with Vercel was seamless
- Combining a portfolio and blog felt natural
- Analytics integration was simple but powerful

Seeing good performance early on was very motivating.

---
## Challenges I Faced

Of course, it wasn’t perfect from the start:
- Deciding how much SEO setup was “enough”
- Styling Markdown content consistently
- Keeping animations subtle
- Balancing portfolio content and blog content on one site

Each challenge helped me understand better how real production sites evolve.

---
## What I Want to Improve Next

This site is only the beginning. Some ideas for the next steps:
- Add an RSS feed
- Implement blog search
- Implement more animations
- Add blog's featured image 
- Improve Core Web Vitals
- Write deeper technical posts about Next.js and SEO

## Final Thoughts

Building this website with Next.js 14 reminded me that the best way to learn is by building something real.

This site will continue to evolve as I learn more — and the blog exists to document that journey.

If you’re thinking about building your own portfolio or blog, my advice is simple: start small, ship early, and improve continuously.
